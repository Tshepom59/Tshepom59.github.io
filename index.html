   		<h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I may be perceived in many different ways by many different people who I have come across over the years, this is because I choose to take each moment as per its own values. Even though this is the case, all can attest to the fact that I am a passionate public servant, driven by the ethos of UBUNTU and more than that I strive to being an inspired Social Entrepreneur, developing tools and platforms for sustained human renewal.</p>

        <p>So for me, entrepreneurship has always been a driving force but one can say that meeting my Moment of Obligation tilted the scales and got me on a one way path. I desire to help develop the unemployable and spiraling youth for the preservation and betterment of communal and human development. This is why I find myself relating very well to the MEST operation. Other than being a conventional charity, MEST is set up as a conducive environment for like-minded people to grow and create partnerships for human renewal.</p>

		<p>I am humbled at the opportunity MEST has granted me, to grow and become an impacting individual. It was not by accident that I came to MEST and neither was it a coincidence but more of the law of Attraction at play, the greater purpose for my life will be fulfilled through my partiipation here.</p>
